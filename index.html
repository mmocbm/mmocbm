              A robot battle, also known as robot combat or robot fighting, is a
              competitive event where robotic machines engage in combat against
              each other. These battles are typically held in controlled arenas
              or arenas specifically designed for robot combat. Participants
              design and build their own robots, equipped with various weapons
              and defenses, to compete against opponents with the goal of
              immobilizing or disabling their opponents' robots.
